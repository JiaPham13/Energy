# Energy
Her retired eyes
 
Once sought castles in the east part of town, and treasures in the night skies.
Now barren, she constrained them.
Like foamy waters taken back by the sea, forbearing to efface delicate handprints.
 
Pushing my feet into the sand, I knelt down beside her.
Crushing waves grew mute, yet incomparable to the silence that existed from the closure of our lips.
With sorrow too vast for our hearts and the unknown too limitless for our labels,
We, wanderers. 
 
Looking beyond the darkening sky, we departed from the banks of this apocalyptic night.
The outside world could no longer penetrate the skin that enclosed Ourselves. 
 
Ineffable thoughts, we became one.
The learned helplessness, I introspected.
She had lost.
Only in her own mind.
 
The quiet taunts. And I complied.
“How beautiful the sky is, yet how ugly we think lies beneath”.
As the silence collapsed, so did the waves.
Crushing and pining, ready to wash away all that had been done.
With a single nod, she no longer kept back her tears.
The beautiful energy, restored.
